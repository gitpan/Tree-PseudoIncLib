Cool Code for Array Initiation:
-------------------------------
@allow_extensions = <<End_of_Lines =~ m/(\S.*\S)g;
	pm
	pod
	htm
	html
End_of_Lines

#       This looks cool, but does not work... The last slash ?..
#       my @simple_keys = <<End_of_Lines =~ m/(\S.*\S)g;
#                       max_nodes
#                       rpm_type
#                       rpm_active
#       End_of_Lines
