Tree/PseudoIncLib version 0.05
==============================

This class still remains on a very early stage of development.
An API is subject to change in further versions.

Detailed description of Perl library on the system is extremely
helpful for every perl developer. It could be benefitial for the
system administrator too in order to ensure a proper structure of
the system libraries.

This module encapsulates the description data and provides methods
for manipulating that data. It was initially developed as an Apache
incorporated tool for the mod_perl development. The idea beside was
pretty simple -- to provide developers with the tree of all available
perl modules installed on the system and make all sources and documents
viewable on network.

As a side effect of the first developed prototype, it appeared to be
usefull additionally from the standpoint of proper configuration of
@INC array on the system, particularly regarding the fact that some
perl modules could be shaded by other ones carrying the same CPAN
class name. It appears to be pretty easy to mark all shaded modules
on the tree, providing helpful information for the system administrator.

It was noticed additionally that the process of creation of the tree
is extremely time consuming, especially on busy web servers equiped
with rich Perl libraries. On the other hand, the content of the libraries
remains unchanged usualy pretty long time that is measured in days and
weeks. So far, the separation of the process of creation of the tree
from the process of deployment of the view to the client browser seems
beneficial from the prospective of improvement of performance on busy
systems. That was the main reason of creation of this module, making it
possible to use the same API from the command line script or one running
under the cron control.

Despite the initial purpose, this version of the module is in no way
associated with any real @INC array on the system. Instead, this module
works with so-called I<pseudo_INC> incoming array that might be, or might
be not directly associated with current @INC for a particular user/process
on the system.
